# Vue Practice

## Tutorial 1

See *Vue.js 2 Academy: Learn Vue Step by Step* by Chris Dixon on SkillShare.

### GuestList

A Simple guest list web app.

How to view:
1. Open index.html in a browser (or use an live server)
2. If you make a change to the data dictionary in `app.js`, then the values of `{{ attribute }}` in `index.html` will change on reload.

Notes:
* The values of the `data` dictionary in `app.js` will populate `{{ attribute }}` in `index.html`.
* I have made an `event` into a dictionary in `app.js` because it is better practice for when we have multiple different events.
